# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

## Loan prediction risk analysis, Overview & Resources:
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. We can use different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Multible libraries and algorithms were used to build and evaluate models using resampling:

  * **`imbalanced-learn`**
  * **`scikit-learn`**
  * **`RandomOverSampler`**
  * **`SMOTE algorithms`**
  * **`ClusterCentroids algorithm`**
  * **`SMOTEENN algorithm`**
  * **`BalancedRandomForestClassifier (bias reduction model)`**
  * **`EasyEnsembleClassifier (bias reduction model)`**

## Purpose
  1. Define how a machine learning algorithms are used in data analytics.
  2. Create training and test groups from data sets.
  3. Implement the logistic **regression**, **decision tree**, **random forest**, and **support vector machine      algorithms**.
